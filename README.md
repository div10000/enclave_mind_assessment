# Enclave Minds – Full Stack Assessment

This repository contains my submission for the Enclave Minds technical assessment.
It includes frontend, backend, and database-focused tasks implemented using Next.js, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB concepts.

## The goal of this assessment was to demonstrate:
- Frontend development skills
- Backend API design
- Authentication basics
- State management
- Clean code structure and clarity

## Tech Stack Used

### Frontend
- Next.js (App Router)
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript

### Backend
- Node.js
- Express.js

### Database (Design / Conceptual)
- MongoDB
- Mongoose

## Project Overview

The project is divided into 7 tasks.
Some tasks are frontend-based, some backend-only, and some focus on system design.
👉🏻 Only tasks that require a UI have a frontend page.

## 📁 Code Location

### Frontend tasks:
Task 1, Task 5, Task 4 (frontend part)
👉🏻 Located inside the `app/` folder

### Backend tasks:
Task 2, Task 3, Task 6, Task 7, Task 4 (backend part)
👉🏻 Located inside the `backend/` folder

## ▶️ How to Run and Get Proper Results

### Step 1
In the root folder run:
```
npm i
```
(This will install all the dependencies)

### Step 2
After installation, in the root project folder, run:
```
npm run dev
```
This will start the frontend on:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

### Step 3
Open a new terminal, go to the backend folder with:
```
cd backend
```

### Step 4
Inside the backend folder, run:
```
node server.js
```
This will start the backend server on:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

Open the frontend (localhost:3000) in the browser to see the assessment overview and UI-based tasks.
